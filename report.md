# **_Project Progress Report_**
## Overview 
<br>

* This report outlines the progress made common tasks

## Project Goals
<br>

* The goal of the  project is to give students to explore the world of technology through practical means.


## Accomplishments
### During the month of March and April 2023, the I accomplished the following:

## TASK 1: 3D Printing
<br>

* Understanding the working of a 3D printer.
* Understanding what's an
STL file  
* learning to slice it 
* Learning about bed
temperature, infill density and other printer settings.
* Finally get an STL file from the internet, and
slice it and put it for print.

## TASK 2: API
<br> 

* Learning the working of an API and its applications. 
* Using an api to 
build an user interface(web app, mobile app, etc), where you can search the weather of any city and then display
the necessary information.

## TASK 3: Working with Github
<br>

* Familiarizeing myself with GitHub integrated workflows (GitHub actions), Issues, and pull requests.
 
 ## TASK 4: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu and do the following subtasks:
 <br> 

● Create a folder named test.<br>
● cd into that folder.<br>
● Create a blank file without using any text editor.<br>
● list the files in that folder<br>
● create 2600 folders in this folder<br>

## TASK 5: Writing Resource Article using Markdown
<br>

* Markdown is an easy-to-use markup language that is used with plain text to add formatting
elements (headings, bulleted lists, URLs) to plain text without the use of a formal text editor , or the use of HTML tags.     
* Markdown is device agnostic and displays the writing format consistently

* Writeing a technical resource article on K-MAP.

## TASK 6: Tinkercad
<br>

* Createing a tinkercad account
*  geting familiar with the application, understanding the example circuits

*using ultrasonic sensor to messure distance between an obstacle and the sensor and Displaying the results on a LCD screen.

## TASK 7: Soldering Prerequisites
<br>


* Learning about the soldering equipment present in our lab, the solder, the soldering iron, soldering
wick, flux, etc. 
* Learning to use them and performing a basic soldering of an LED circuit on a perf board.

## TASK 8: Karnaugh Maps and Deriving the logic circuit
<br>

* Description: For 4 cases, based on door lock/open and key pressed/not pressed.
* Determineing the
karnaugh map and make a burglar alarm using simple logic circuits.
* The buzzer or led blinks
when certain conditions are met, you can use push buttons for the door and key.

## TASK 9: Create a Portfolio Webpage
<br>

* Createing a website to showcase my portfolio - about yourself, my tasks, social media profiles and more.




## Challenges

### The following challenges were encountered during the project:
<br>

* Learning to work with new tools and technologies.
* Understanding the concepts and applying them effectively.
* Managing time effectively to complete tasks within deadlines.
* Debugging errors and issues encountered while working on different tasks.
* Balancing multiple tasks and prioritizing them according to their importance and deadline.


## Conclusion
<br>

* Overall, I made significant progress in learning and implementing various technical skills through practical means
* as outlined in the project goals. I accomplished tasks related to 3D printing, APIs, GitHub, command line on Ubuntu, Markdown, Tinkercad, soldering, K-maps, and creating a portfolio webpage.
*  However, I also encountered several challenges, including learning new tools and technologies, managing time effectively, and debugging errors. Despite these challenges, I was able to complete the tasks within the given timeline and gain valuable experience and knowledge.
